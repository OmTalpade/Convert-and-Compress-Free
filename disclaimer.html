            <h2>1. General Information Only</h2>
            <p>
                Convert and Compress Free is provided as a tool to help users convert and compress images online. While
                we aim to provide a reliable and user-friendly <strong>image converter</strong> and
                <strong>image compressor</strong>, all information and functionality on the website is offered on an
                “as is” and “as available” basis. We do not provide professional advice of any kind, including but not
                limited to legal, financial, or technical advice.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are solely responsible for how you use the tool and for evaluating whether the outputs are suitable
                for your particular needs and use cases.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Accuracy and Completeness</h2>
            <p>
                We make reasonable efforts to ensure that the website functions correctly and that the
                <strong>online image converter</strong> and <strong>online image compressor</strong> behave as
                described. However, we do not guarantee that the site will always be accurate, complete, or free from
                errors, bugs, or interruptions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Image formats, browser capabilities, and device configurations vary widely. As a result, some images may
                not be processed as expected. For example, HEIC to JPG conversion depends on browser-level support for
                HEIC files. We cannot guarantee that every file type or every individual image will convert or compress
                successfully.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Use at Your Own Risk</h2>
            <p>
                By using Convert and Compress Free, you acknowledge that you do so at your own risk. You are responsible
                for verifying the quality, accuracy, and suitability of any files generated by the tool before using
                them in production, publishing them online, or sharing them with others.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should keep backups of your original files before using any <strong>image size reducer</strong> or
                conversion tool. We are not responsible for any loss of data, corruption of files, or unintended
                modifications that may occur as a result of using the website.
            </p>

            <h2>4. No Liability</h2>
            <p>
                To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Convert and Compress Free and its owners, operators,
                contributors, and affiliates shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential,
                special, or punitive damages arising out of or related to your use of the website or any content,
                services, or tools offered on or through it.
            </p>
            <p>
                This includes, without limitation, damages for loss of profits, loss of data, business interruption,
                reputational harm, or other commercial losses, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such
                damages. Your sole and exclusive remedy for dissatisfaction with the website is to stop using it.
            </p>

            </p>

                We have no control over the content, policies, or practices of third-party websites and are not
                responsible or liable for any damage, loss, or issues arising from your use of such sites. You access

            <h2>6. Technical Limitations</h2>
            <p>
                Convert and Compress Free relies on modern web technologies and browser features to perform tasks such
                as converting JPG to PNG, PNG to JPG, WebP to JPG, JPG to WebP, PNG to WebP, and HEIC to JPG in
                supported environments. Not all devices or browsers support the same image formats or APIs.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not guarantee compatibility with all hardware, operating systems, or browsers. Performance and
                results may vary depending on your device, browser version, and network conditions. We are not
                responsible for any limitations imposed by your environment.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>
                You retain all rights to the original images you upload and to the converted or compressed files
                generated through the website, subject to any applicable third-party rights. You are responsible for
                ensuring that you have the rights and permissions necessary to process, convert, or share any images
                using the tool.
            </p>
            <p>
                You must not use the website to infringe the intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or other
                legal rights of any third party.
            </p>
